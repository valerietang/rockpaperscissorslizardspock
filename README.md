# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
The Big Bang Theory's Sheldon loves Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock so I made a real-life version where it's you VS my code!
The game itself should be self-explanatory, but may I suggest the advice of Spock in the unlikely event you might be confused... "When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
